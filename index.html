       <p>I am told a <strong>whippersnapper</strong> jokingly equates to a millenial. By definition a whippersnapper is: "a young person who annoys older people by being very confident and acting like someone important (<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/whippersnapper">Merriam-Webster</a>)." It is a word often used to describe the millenials taking over Silicon Valley, but I'd like to think we are just a generation shaped by the ones before us. I'd like to think that a whippersnapper is <b>anyone</b> with creative solutions to real world problems - albeit young and/or inexperienced.  Therefore, let it be re-written, that a whippersnapper is a bold individual who is full of brillant ideas to improve the world around them. </p>
